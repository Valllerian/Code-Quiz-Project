## Installation

https://github.com/Valllerian/Code-Quiz-Project

## Usage

Main page includes the clickable button to start the game:

<br>
<img alt="Main Page screenchot" src="assets/images/image1.jpg" />
<br>

After clicking Start button we are prompted with 5 questions:

<br>
<img alt="length selection prompt" src="assets/images/image2.jpg" />
<br>


Answering the question with the wrong answer button will decrease the timer by 30 seconds and will give a prompt that 
the answer was wrong. If answer is correct - next question would be displayed and "Correct" prompt would appear.

<br>
<img alt="invalid length alert" src="assets/images/image3.jpg" />
<br>

After answering all questions or after timer runs out user would be asked for the name to save their score.

<br>
<img alt="types of characters selection" src="assets/images/image4.jpg" />
<br>

Back on the main page user can click on show score button to show their last score.
